# Infinite_Scroll
## This is similar to what happens in social media apps like Instagram and Facebook where we experience infinite scrolling tons of posts and memes.
### So how it happens is, as the user scroll at the bottom of the page another network request is made. And this network request happens before we reach the end of the page and thus it feels like we are seamlessly scrolling to posts or memes.
